# VSD-IAT: Static Timing Analysis - Basics to Advanced
![flyer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68592620/220321874-458e55b3-e193-4734-8070-2a2477eaca27.png)  
STA stands for Static Timing Analysis. It is a method to verify the timing correctness of a chip. It evaluates the delays of each timing path in a digital circuit incurred when a signal propagates through it. By this delay calculation, it is able to determine whether the chip meets or violates the timing constraints. In this workshop we studied the concepts involved in STA from basics to advanced, with the help of open source STA tools and libraries.

## ▫️ Abstract
In this 5 days workshop we have used open-source sign-off timing analysis tool STA and open-source Sky130 libraries, to perform the day-wise labs.
Each day has a specific set of task to be completed under this workshop. Following is the detailed proof of work of labs of each day.
