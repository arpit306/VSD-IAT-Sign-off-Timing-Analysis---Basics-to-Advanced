# VSD-IAT: Static Timing Analysis - Basics to Advanced
![flyer](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/68592620/220321874-458e55b3-e193-4734-8070-2a2477eaca27.png)  
STA stands for Static Timing Analysis. It is a method to verify the timing correctness of a chip. It evaluates the delays of each timing path in a digital circuit incurred when a signal propagates through it. By this delay calculation, it is able to determine whether the chip meets or violates the timing constraints. In this workshop we study the concepts involved in STA from basics to advanced, with the help of open source STA tools and libraries.
